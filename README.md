_jailer.sh_ is a wrapper script for managing iocage jails on FreeBSD. It can update and upgrade individual or all jails and their ports. It can create jails and has a nice templating system for them (flavours).

Jost copy _jailer.sh_ anywhere in your path and the â€žjailer" direcory to _/usr/local/etc_. See __/usr/local/etc/jailer/flavours_ for a sample jail. You can put system files in the flavours that should be copied to the jail, you can specify fstab entries that should be enabled in the jail and you can define programs that will be installed in the jail. See _jail.cfg_ for an example for iocage properties that are set when the jail will be created.
